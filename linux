1) What is Linux?
Linux is an operating system (OS).
An operating system is the middleman between:
You (user)
Applications (Chrome, Docker, Jenkins, etc.)
Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)

Linux is:
Open-source (anyone can see & modify code)
Free (most of the time)
Very stable and secure
Used mostly on servers, cloud, DevOps, containers

👉 Linux is not a single OS, it is a kernel.
Different companies add tools and create Linux distributions:
Ubuntu
CentOS
RHEL
Amazon Linux
**Linux is an open-source operating system kernel used to build secure, stable, multi-user operating systems mainly for servers and cloud environments.

2)Difference between Unix and Linux?
| Unix                | Linux               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Proprietary         | Open-source         |
| Paid                | Mostly Free         |
| Company owned       | Community driven    |
| Used in old systems | Used everywhere now |

Linux is an open-source Unix-like operating system, whereas Unix is proprietary and vendor-controlled.

3️⃣ Difference between Linux vs Windows vs macOS?
| Feature       | Linux          | Windows      | macOS         |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Source        | Open           | Closed       | Closed        |
| Cost          | Free           | Paid         | Paid          |
| Usage         | Servers, Cloud | Personal PCs | Apple devices |
| Security      | Very High      | Medium       | High          |
| Customization | Very High      | Low          | Medium        |
| DevOps        | Best           | Poor         | Medium        |

Linux is preferred for servers due to security and flexibility, Windows is user-friendly for desktops, and macOS is Unix-based optimized for Apple hardware.

4)🧠 Linux Architecture (From Scratch)?*********
User
 ↓
Applications
 ↓
Shell
 ↓
Kernel
 ↓
Hardware

1️⃣ Hardware Layer

This is the physical part of the system:
CPU
RAM
Hard Disk
Network Card
Keyboard, Mouse
💡 Hardware cannot understand commands directly from users.

2️⃣ Kernel (❤️ Heart of Linux)

Kernel is the core of Linux.
It acts like a traffic police 🚦 between:
Applications
Hardware
Kernel responsibilities:
Process management
Memory management
File system
Device drivers
Networking
Security

⚠️ If kernel crashes → system crashes

Kernel is the core component of Linux that manages hardware resources and provides services to applications.

Shell (Command Interpreter)

3.Shell is a translator 🗣️
It converts:
👉 Human commands
👉 Into kernel-understandable instructions

Common shells:
bash
sh
zsh

4️⃣ What is a System Call?

A system call is the mechanism through which a user-space program requests a service from the kernel.

User programs cannot directly access hardware or kernel memory. Instead, they use system calls as a controlled interface.

Examples:

open() → open file

read() → read data

write() → write data

fork() → create new process

exec() → execute program

System calls ensure secure communication between user space and kernel space.

In simple words:
System call = Gateway from user space to kernel space.

5️⃣ What is User Space vs Kernel Space?
User Space

This is where applications and user programs run.
It has limited privileges and cannot directly access hardware.

Examples:

nginx

docker

vim

python scripts

If an application crashes in user space, the system continues running.

Kernel Space

This is where the Linux kernel operates.
It has full access to hardware and system memory.

Responsibilities:

Process scheduling

Memory allocation

Device drivers

Networking stack

File systems

If a problem occurs in kernel space, it can crash the entire system.

6️⃣ What happens when you run a command like ls?

When you type ls, the following sequence happens:

The shell reads the command.

It searches for the executable in directories listed in the PATH variable.

Once found (e.g., /bin/ls), it loads the program into memory.

The program makes system calls like:

open()

read()

The kernel processes these system calls and retrieves directory data.

The output is sent back to user space.

The shell prints the result to the terminal.

Flow:

User → Shell → System Call → Kernel → Hardware → Output

This answer is very commonly asked in interviews.

4️⃣ System Libraries
🔹 English Explanation

System libraries are pre-written code helpers.

Applications use them to:

Talk to kernel

Avoid writing low-level code

Example:

glibc

🔹 Real-Time Example

When a program needs memory:
👉 It calls library
👉 Library calls kernel

🔹 Interview Points

Libraries provide APIs

Bridge between apps & kernel

🔹 Telugu Explanation

System libraries ante ready-made helper code

Apps direct ga kernel ni touch cheyavu
👉 Library use chesi matladutayi

5️⃣ Applications / User Space

This is where users work.
Includes:
Terminal
Browser
Docker
Jenkins
Kubernetes tools
Apps never directly access hardware.

Architecture full explanation:
Linux architecture follows a layered model. The user interacts with the system through the shell by running commands. 
These commands invoke user-space utilities, which use system libraries like glibc. 
The libraries internally make system calls to request services from the kernel. 
The kernel, being the core of Linux, manages processes, memory, files, devices, networking, and communicates directly with the hardware.

5) Kernel vs Shell
| Feature          | Kernel       | Shell      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Role             | Core of OS   | Interface  |
| Runs in          | Kernel space | User space |
| Hardware access  | Yes          | No         |
| User interaction | No           | Yes        |
| Crash impact     | Whole system | Only shell |
| Examples         | Process mgmt | bash, zsh  |
